    """
    Class that represents the state of the basecalling processing, as well as
    providing methods for operating on it.

    Essentially all the raw output from the Oxford Nano Pore sequencing machine
    consists of .FAST5 files that the machine writes to a specific directory we'll
    refer to as INPUT_DIR.

    Each raw file, is the recording of the electrical signal corresponding to the
    particular DNA chunk that was sequenced. The chunks are known as frags, while the
    recordings are also called squibbles because of the shape of the resulting graph.
    Basically this raw data represents electrical current/potential over time.

    For each file, a corresponding .FASTQ file must be produced and stored in
    OUTPUT_DIR.

    This is the basecalled file: a very long string of 4 letters representing the
    biological bases, G A T C, that translates the raw electrical signals.

    The actual basecalling functionality is carried out by a different software/system,
    i.e. the GUPPY system. But there are also other systems such as BONITO that can be used.
    This software is needed because the algorithms involved in basecalling make use of
    neural networks in order to translate the electrical signals, and so are rather
    specialised for the task requiring also the availability of GPUs.

    Several instances of the GUPPY servers are expected to be available: at least one for each
    GPU in the infrastructure. Moreover, each GUPPY server is designed to work on multiple files
    which it expects to be present in a specified directory.

    The class allows raw files to be assigned to one of the GUPPY server for processing. This
    will be reflected in the filesystem by the presence of the following structure:

    INPUT_DIR
        |- JOB-ID1_GUPPY-SERVER-NAME_inputdir
            |- file1.fast5   (ATTENTION! IT WILL BE A SYMLINK!)
            |- file2.fast5   (ATTENTION! IT WILL BE A SYMLINK!)
            |- file3.fast5   (ATTENTION! IT WILL BE A SYMLINK!)
