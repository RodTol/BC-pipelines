class BCKeepAlive(threading.Thread):
    """
    Class that encapsulates a thread where the BCEngine constantly informs the BCController on the state
    of the ongoing processing.

    It implements a resiliance protocol, thereby signalling to initiate a SHUTDOWN should the communication
    with the BC Controller encounter any problem: a crash, a network interruption, a malfunctioning. Likewise
    the BC Controller is aware of this protocol, so it knows we'll shutdown as soon as possible and eventually
    be restarted with a cleared internal state.

    In general, the Single Writer principle is followed: volatile variables are used where there is by design
    a single Thread expected to write/change a variable, while any number of threads can read that variable. In
    Python this is not needed, but it's important to spell it out in order to clarify the design and intended
    way of usage (indeed there is no 'volatile' in python).

    Essentially, the main thread where basecalling is happening, should get an instance and start the keepalive;
    then it should periodically check whether there are problems with the bc controller and so terminate; or upon
    completion of processing, it should communicate back the result and terminate the keepalive thread.

    Convenience methods have been provided, so they can be invoked on a BCKeepAlive instance; however it is
    possible also to check/interact directly with the internal 'volatile' variables: provided the resiliance
    protocol logic is implemented i.e. decide when to shutdown.
